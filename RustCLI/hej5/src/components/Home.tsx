From the one and only Flodhest, first of his name, leader of the Pinkish Herd, and the continental dominator of Africa, and many thanks to Pablo Escobarâ€” we also reside with sovereignty in the Colombian woodlands, on top of the food chain. We do not fear, we do not compromise, we have tiny ears but enormous hearts. That is all.</p>
