        <li>
          <strong>Project Structure:</strong> Establishes a robust and organized architecture by configuring essential directories, such as services, models, components, styles, middleware, utility, and the source code itself. The design adheres to a Component-Based Architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns within the React application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>File Templates:</strong> Integrates fundamental files and boilerplate code into the project, covering key elements like placeholder components, backend services, models, environment configuration files, and a service worker. These templates expedite the development process and provide a solid foundation for building a feature-rich React application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TypeScript-Based React App:</strong> Generates a React app using TypeScript, providing strong static typing and an improved developer experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Material-UI Integration & Responsive Design:</strong> Enhances the visual appeal and user experience by seamlessly incorporating Material-UI components. Includes setup for either Material-UI or custom media-queries for mobile, tablets, and desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SPA and Browser Router:</strong> Create a Single Page Application (SPA), providing smooth and uninterrupted user navigation. The inclusion of a Browser Router enables efficient client-side routing, enhancing the overall user experience with seamless transitions between different views.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Web App (PWA):</strong> Elevates your application to Progressive Web App standards by registering a foundational service worker. This feature enables offline access, background updates, and an enhanced user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Jest Testing:</strong> Includes Jest for efficient and reliable unit testing of your React components, ensuring the robustness and reliability of your application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environment Files:</strong> Creates environment configuration files (`.env.development` and `.env.production`) to manage environment-specific variables. These files allow you to define variables like API endpoints or feature toggles for development and production environments separately.
